## Limitations

### Known Limitations
1. **Domain Specialization**: Optimized for reasoning tasks, may have limitations in creative writing, general conversation, or domain-specific knowledge outside training scope
2. **Legal Advice Disclaimer**: Provides educational legal analysis only, not professional legal advice
3. **Verification Required**: While highly accurate, outputs should be verified for critical applications
4. **Context Constraints**: Limited to 32K token context window
5. **Language**: Primarily trained and tested in English

### Technical Limitations  
- Memory requirements: ~14GB for full precision inference
- Inference speed depends on hardware capabilities
- May require specific software dependencies (transformers, peft)

## Bias and Fairness

### Bias Mitigation Efforts
- Diverse reasoning problem selection
- Manual review of training examples
- Testing across different problem types and complexity levels
- Continuous monitoring of model outputs

### Known Biases
- May reflect biases present in base Mistral model
- Training data primarily from Western legal and educational contexts
- Potential bias toward formal logical reasoning approaches

### Fairness Considerations
- Model designed for educational use across diverse populations
- Open source licensing enables community oversight
- Transparent documentation of capabilities and limitations

## Environmental Impact

### Carbon Footprint
- Training conducted on single RTX 3060 GPU
- Relatively efficient LoRA training vs full model fine-tuning
- Estimated training time: <24 hours total
- Carbon impact significantly lower than training large models from scratch

### Efficiency Measures
- LoRA fine-tuning reduces computational requirements
- Optimized inference for various hardware configurations
- Support for CPU-only inference to reduce GPU dependence

## Ethical Considerations

### Responsible Use
- Clear documentation of intended use cases
- Explicit warnings about limitations and verification needs
- Educational focus with appropriate disclaimers
- Open source to enable community review

### Potential Misuse
- Should not be used for professional legal, medical, or financial advice
- Not suitable for critical decision-making without human oversight
- May be misused if presented as infallible reasoning system

### Mitigation Strategies
- Clear usage guidelines and disclaimers
- Educational focus in documentation
- Open source licensing for transparency
- Community feedback mechanisms

## Technical Specifications

### System Requirements
- **Minimum**: 16GB RAM, modern CPU
- **Recommended**: 16GB+ GPU, 32GB+ system RAM
- **Software**: Python 3.8+, PyTorch 2.0+, Transformers 4.44+

### Deployment Options
- Local inference (GPU/CPU)
- Cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Edge deployment (with quantization)
- API integration via FastAPI/Flask
